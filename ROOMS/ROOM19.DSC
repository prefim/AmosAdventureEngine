The village seems fairly small, a few huts and pathways thread around the area. There are a few villagers going about their day to day. All seems calm.
END
PATH
The paths are mostly gravel, some are dirt.
VILLAGERS
People of all ages to and fro along the paths. Some carrying goods or food, some handling farming tools.
